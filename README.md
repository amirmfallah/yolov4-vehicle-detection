# YOLOv4 Vehicle Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv4 for vehicle detection using Python and OpenCV. The project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, specifically YOLOv4, to detect vehicles in video streams and images efficiently.

## Demo

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
